   <p style="text-align: center; color: darkred; font-size: 30px;">The Solar System: An Overview</p>
   <p>The Solar System is a vast and fascinating region of space dominated by the Sun, a medium-sized star at its center. It includes a diverse collection of celestial bodies—planets, moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and more—all bound together by the force of gravity.</p>
   <p><strong> Sun: The Heart of the System</strong></p>
   <p>At the center of the Solar System lies the Sun, a glowing ball of hot plasma that contains about 99.8% of the system's total mass. It provides the light and heat necessary for life on Earth and governs the orbits of all nearby objects with its immense gravitational pull.</p>
   <p><b>The Planets</b></p>
   <p>There are eight recognized planets in the Solar System, which are divided into two main groups:</p>
   <p><b>Dwarf Planets</b></p>
   <p>Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy bodies. Here we find Pluto, once classified as the ninth planet but now considered a dwarf planet, along with others like Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.</p>
   <p><b>Moons</b></p>
   <p>Many planets have natural satellites or moons. Earth has one, but Jupiter and Saturn each have over 80. Some moons, like Jupiter’s Europa or Saturn’s Enceladus, may harbor subsurface oceans and are key targets in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
   <p><b>Asteroids and Comets</b></p>
   <ul>
    <li>Asteroids are rocky bodies, mostly found in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Comets are icy bodies that develop tails when they approach the Sun, usually originating from the Kuiper Belt or the distant Oort Cloud.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><b>The Edge of the Solar System</b></p>
   <p>The outermost boundary is thought to be the Oort Cloud, a distant, spherical shell of icy bodies that may mark the edge of the Sun's gravitational influence. Beyond this lies interstellar space.</p>
   <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
   <p>The Solar System is a dynamic and complex environment, rich in history and full of mysteries still waiting to be discovered. As technology advances, missions to explore planets, moons, and distant objects continue to expand our understanding of the universe and our place within it.</p>
